# Gorilla Locomotion
This is a dummy module that provides functions and values simular to those shown in the [GorillaLocomotion](https://github.com/Another-Axiom/GorillaLocomotion) Unity package by Gorilla Tag. It does not have real functionality, it is only meant for making ``psuedo-like`` mods in Luau.

For Lua developers, this package requires [Luau](https://github.com/luau-lang/luau) to be installed.

## Usage
```lua
local GorillaLocomotion = require("GorillaLocomotion")

local GLM_Player = GorillaLocomotion.Player
```
